# Refactor Hotspots (Agent Handoff)

Last validated: 2026-03-09

This document tracks large/complex files that are most likely to slow down follow-up sessions.

## Prioritized Runtime Targets

1. `app/chat/hooks/useChat.ts`
   - High state density + side effects.
   - Suggested split: network orchestration, state selectors, UI event handlers.
2. `app/(components)/homeProductSection.tsx`
   - Large render tree and interaction logic in one file.
   - Suggested split: list item card, filter bar, sorting/paging model.
3. `components/order/orderDetails.tsx`
   - Dense conditional UI logic.
   - Suggested split: status panel, payment panel, line-items table.
4. `app/chat/components/recommendedProductActions.resolve.support.ts`
   - Category fallback alias policy and cache-key rules still influence recommendation matching quality.
   - Suggested follow-up: keep synonym tuning and generic-category rules isolated here.
5. `lib/ai/chain.ts`
   - Core AI chain orchestration with broad responsibilities.
   - Suggested split: prompt construction, context gathering, and post-processing.
6. `lib/b2b/export/layout-dsl.ts`
   - Large DSL construction logic with mixed concerns (layout structure + render semantics).
   - Suggested split: page block builders, style-token mapping, and preset composition.
7. `app/(admin)/admin/b2b-reports/B2bAdminReportClient.tsx`
   - Admin report page still combines filter state, fetch orchestration, and rendering concerns in one file.
   - Suggested split: query-state model hook, table/list presentation blocks, and export action controller.
8. `lib/server/hyphen/fetch-ai-summary-core.ts`
   - NHIS summary orchestration contains prompt IO and business fallback logic together.
   - Suggested split: input policy assembly, model call adapter, and post-merge serializer.
9. `app/api/messages/stream/token/route.ts`
   - Route keeps guard-token touch boilerplate for static audits.
   - Suggested split: standardized guard-touch helper pattern across guarded thin routes.
10. `app/api/admin/b2b/employees/[employeeId]/note/route.ts`, `app/api/admin/b2b/employees/[employeeId]/report/route.ts`, `app/api/admin/b2b/employees/[employeeId]/survey/route.ts`
    - Three sibling routes still carry repetitive runtime/dynamic/error constant scaffolding.
    - Suggested split: shared route shell factory for employee subresource endpoints.

## Guardrails For Any Refactor

1. Do not change auth ownership checks in API routes without `lib/server/route-auth.ts`.
2. Keep NHIS low-cost fetch defaults intact (`checkupOverview`, `medication`).
3. Keep AI summary enrichment non-blocking for fetch core flow.
4. Run before merge:
   - `npm run audit:encoding`
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npm run build`
5. Agent/R&D onboarding artifacts moved to `C:/dev/wellnessbox-rnd/docs/legacy_from_wellnessbox/agents/`.
   Service repo follow-up checks stay limited to runtime-safe commands such as `npm run audit:hotspots`.
